# Dedalus Perl SDK implementation checklist

- [x] Audit Python template and capture requirements
  - [x] Review `README.md`, `api.md`, `pyproject.toml`, and `src/dedalus_labs`
  - [x] Enumerate public APIs and shared models
  - [x] Note cross-cutting helpers (retries, multipart, query serialization)
- [ ] Bootstrap Perl distribution skeleton
  - [x] Set up CPAN-style layout (`lib/`, `t/`, `script/`, etc.)
  - [x] Choose build/dependency tooling and capture metadata
  - [x] Port docs into Perl-centric `README.md` and stub `api.md`
- [ ] Implement configuration, auth, and environment handling
  - [x] Add `Dedalus::Config` with env + version info
  - [x] Create `Dedalus::Exception` hierarchy
- [ ] Build HTTP client abstraction
  - [x] Implement sync HTTP layer with retries, serialization, multipart
  - [x] Create `Dedalus::Client` wrapper exposing resources
- [ ] Define data models and serialization utilities
  - [ ] Port shared request/response types under `lib/Dedalus/Types/*`
  - [ ] Add model coercion, validation, and file helpers
- [ ] Implement resource modules (API surface)
  - [x] Implement `health` resource and integration example
  - [x] Implement `models` resource (list & retrieve)
  - [x] Implement `embeddings` resource
  - [x] Implement `audio.transcriptions` resource
  - [x] Implement `images` resource (generate/edit/variation)
  - [x] Implement `audio.translations` + `audio.speech` resources
  - [x] Mirror Python resource namespaces (chat, audio, files, etc.)
  - [ ] Support nested sub-resources and consistent signatures
- [x] Add streaming and async support
  - [x] Implement SSE streaming helpers
  - [x] Provide `Dedalus::Async` built on async primitives
- [ ] Handle file uploads and multipart logic
  - [ ] Port `_files.py` behaviors for IO handles, metadata
- [ ] Build testing strategy
  - [ ] Port behavior-driven tests using Perl testing frameworks
  - [ ] Stub HTTP interactions and add smoke/golden tests
- [ ] Configure tooling, CI, and release automation
  - [ ] Add lint/format tooling and CI workflows
  - [ ] Document release process (Changes, tagging, CPAN upload)
